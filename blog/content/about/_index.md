Hello! My name is Senyo Simpson. I am a 22 year old machine learning engineer residing in the beautiful city Cape Town, South Africa. Currently, I am working at an amazing startup,
[Aerobotics](https://aerobotics.com), where we are building the next generation of smart technology in the agriculture industry. From an academic standpoint, my interests lie in 
statistical machine learning. Topics such as probabilisitic generative modeling, approximate inference, density estimation and the likes are fascinating and the theory is beautiful to
say the least (if only I understood it properly haha!). From an industry perspective, I am passionate about building products leveraging machine learning. This encompasses the building and 
productionising of machine learning algorithms, a notoriously difficult but interesting problem. Machine learning in industry comes with many concerns: inference speed, data provenance, 
reproducibility, scalabale infrastructure, concept drift and many more. This is where my heart lies as I believe machine learning in industry has the potential to be transformational in many
important fields.

Outside of work and technology, I spend my time ... coding! I am an avid lover of music, reading and podcasts and spend countless hours embroiled in their stories. I also have an affinity
for digital art. The level of creativity, precision and dynamism displayed by many digital artists is beyond admirable. As a person who loves aesthetics, you'll often find me in the most beautiful
settings I can find, made much easier by living in Cape Town. From hiking, to wine tasting at some of the world's finest wine farms to going to some of the most beautiful beaches, we are spoilt
for choice in this city!

A little less about me, so what is Bloom? Bloom is where I share my journey as an industry professional, documenting the various lessons I learn as a I learn them. Being young, energetic,
new to industry and working in a fast-paced environment, I am learning more lessons than I could possibly have imagined. I believe writing is a powerful medium, not only to share knowledge
but also to consolidates one's learning. Bloom, ultimately, serves those two purposes.

I hope you find this blog inspiring and you'll hopefully start your own blog! Feel free to reach out, I am always willing to chat and learn from others.
