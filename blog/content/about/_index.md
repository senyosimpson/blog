Wagwan, I'm Senyo Simpson. I am a 23 year old machine learning engineer residing in the beautiful city of Cape Town, South Africa. I work at [Aerobotics](https://aerobotics.com) where we are building the next generation of smart technology in the agriculture industry. From an academic standpoint, my interests lie in 
statistical machine learning. Topics such as probabilisitic generative modeling, approximate inference, density estimation and the likes are fascinating and the theory is beautiful to
say the least (if only I understood it properly ðŸ˜†). From an industry perspective, I am passionate about building highly available and scalable systems with machine learning at their center.

A little less about me, so what is Bloom? Bloom is where I share my journey as an industry professional, documenting the various lessons I learn as a I learn them. Being young, energetic, new to industry and working in a fast-paced environment, I am learning more lessons than I could possibly have imagined. I believe writing is a powerful medium, not only to share knowledge
but also to consolidates one's learning. Bloom, ultimately, serves those two purposes.

I hope you find this blog inspiring and you'll hopefully start your own blog! Feel free to reach out, I am always willing to chat and learn from others.
