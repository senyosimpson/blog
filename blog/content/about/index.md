Wagwan, I'm Senyo! I am a 23 year old machine learning engineer residing in the beautiful city Cape Town, South Africa. I work at [Aerobotics](https://aerobotics.com) where we are building the next generation of smart technology in the agriculture industry. My interests lie in both machine learning and software engineering. From the machine learning perspective, I enjoy statistical machine learning. Topics such as probabilisitic generative modeling, approximate inference, density estimation and the likes are fascinating. The theory is beautiful to say the least (if only I understood it properly ðŸ˜†). From the software engineering perspective, I am particularly interested in distributed systems and the infrastructure necessary to run software reliably at scale. I am excited about the merger of great software and systems engineering with machine learning.

I have a growing passion for tech leadership, even though I am still very much in the beginning of my career. I consider myself an enabler; striving to enable others to do their best work. This not only includes tooling and infra for making direct code contribution frictionless but also enabling others to contribute to the broader technical story of the business.

A little less about me, so what is Bloom? Bloom is a collection of my thoughts and learnings on software, machine learning, tech leadership and the tech industry. I believe writing is a powerful medium, not only to share knowledge but also to consolidates one's learning. Bloom serves those two purposes.

I hope you find this blog inspiring and *eventually* start your own! Feel free to reach out, I am always willing to chat and learn from others.
