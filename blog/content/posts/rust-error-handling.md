Before coming into Rust, I never knew error handling was such a *big* deal. Rust's story is still
developing and as a result there are conversations about every aspect of the language. As there is
a massive emphasis on making developing in Rust enjoyable, you can imagine how much healthy debate
goes on. Just ask anyone about async Rust. With that being said, error handling is an ongoing and
important discussion. The language attempts to make error handling ergonomic. I they've done a great job
of it so far. As I started to dig into it, I realised there was so much I had never considered. I am
convinced that writing good errors and good error handling are part of the core tenets of writing
good software. Alongside this, they contribute immensely to the developer experience. Anyone who has
come across the Rust compiler's errors messages will tell you the world of difference they have made.
Without further ado, let's jump into the world of error handling.

## A kind introduction

I have a growing interest in distributed systems. In distributed systems, the strongest guarantee you have
is that they will fail; failure is normal. These systems are built to have a high tolerance to failure. If
there is anything that has stuck with me since diving into the world of distributed systems, it's "build
for failure". This thinking rapidly permeates to all aspects of software development. When writing code,
ignoring error paths is asking for a disaster. I know from experience, that used to be yours truly. Runtime
errors were my best friend for an unreasonably long period of time ðŸ˜†. I have subsequently left my dark ways.
Error handling is such an important part of development precisely because it allows us to handle failure.
This makes understanding code and the myriad ways it may fail easier to digest. Debugging is also made
significantly easier by good error messages and handling.

Newer breeds of languages (e.g Rust, Go) have turned to returning errors instead of using exceptions. Coming
from Python, I found this strange but quickly became a fan, particularly of Rust's approach to it. The mix of
encoding errors in the type system, making them explicit in function signatures and enforcing explicitly
handling errors solved a whole host of problems I had been facing in Python, some of them due to my own
sloppiness. Some of the reasons I prefer this paradigm:

* Exceptions are hidden. With Python being a dynamically typed language, looking at a function signature gives
  you no indication of whether an exception will be thrown. Any function in Python *could* throw an exception.
  Short of reading the source code or the documentation, you're left for dead. Statically typed languages with
  exceptions do solve this problem. For example, Java function signatures declare the exceptions they throw.
* Exceptions are often misused. They should only be used in *exception*-al cases. This is one of those dogmatic
  phrases in tech. In reality, this is contextual. For example, if you need to a read file and have no upfront
  expectation that it should be there, it is not an exceptional case and an exception should not be thrown. The
  logic should handle it. However, if you do expect the file to be there, throwing an exception makes sense.
  Unfortunately, in many cases where exceptions don't need to be thrown, they are. In some way, this is a
  problem with the *programmer* and not the paradigm. However, paradigms that can be misused will most likely
  be and therefore, it's better for it to enforce sane behaviour by its definition.
* Exceptions are often used for control flow. The problem with using exceptions for control flow is that they
  obscure your code. It makes difficult for a developer to follow the path of execution through the code base.
* Pokemon exception handling. In Java and in Python, it's possible to catch all exceptions by using syntax like
  `catch Exception` since all exceptions subclass `Exception`. This makes debugging failure modes extremely
  difficult. If your code starts producing weird outputs, it's impossible to tell because errors are caught
  silently by the catch all statement. This is again one of the cases that's the fault of the developer but
  the system gives you an easy way out and is thus used. In fact, a similar thing happens in Golang too. Since
  you can write `value, _ := funcWithErrReturn()`, you can just ignore the error. 
* Try-catch syntax is verbose.

Some advantages of returning errors:

* It is explicit. This is not strictly true as dynamic languages won't have this either. However, since a function    
  returns a value and/or an error, you cannot assume the value is valid unless you have checked if an error has
  occured. This makes it easy to handle failure cases in code.
* Unrecoverable errors are uncommon. In Go and in Rust, there is a `panic` construct. When a program panics, it
  crashes and dies; there is no recovery possible. Often times, panicking is left to the application level. Library
  code never panics, rather passing the error up to the caller to decide if it can continue. This is great as you have
  strong guarantees on your code never failing unexpectedly. Panics are reserved for severe cases.
* It encourages proper error handling. I say encourage because it is very easy to ignore errors in Golang. Similarly,
  exceptions are often ignored resulting in programs crashing. Alternatively, they are caught with a catch all try-except
  and life moves on. Rust makes it impossible to ignore errors if you need to use the value but we will come back to that.
* There is normal control flow. Since errors are just returned, control flow is easy to follow.
