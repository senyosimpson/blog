1. Breadth first then depth at an early stage - this applies to learning and your direction in tech (play around with different facets of technology). When learning depth, focus on foundations. The abstractions (e.g frameworks) will change but the database it abstracts will have core principles you need to know about.
2. If you're in the right environment, continually push above your weight
3. Look up from your monitors - there's a business around you. Get involved in some aspect of it
4. Get involved in the tech community around you
5. Coding for money is the best reason to code - don't let anyone lie to you about this
6. Focus on gathering intuition as a developer
7. Building products is hard and depends on so many other things other than the tech - customer feedback, prioritising features, in ML - data requirements and debugging
8. At a tech first company, it's easy to feel important. However, a company cannot run without the input from everyone - always a team effort.
9. Just because you're a junior, it does not implicitly mean you're a worse developer than those above you - there's a lot of levels to this
10. With prioritising features - you do have to learn to say no. Everything will feel important
11. You get better by leveraging the knowledge of seniors. Ask them questions on anything you've thought about - does not have to be related to your actual work at the time.
12. Ditch the idea that some technology is the *best* - that's how you have fanboys of certain languages, frameworks, design and architectural patterns. Everything is use case specific and all that matters is what *trade-offs* need to be made. For example, there's a move to microservices. This is *often* not the best choice for your company at the stage it is at. Rather build your monolith with the idea of microservices in mind.
13. You should care about your customers. If you're an infrastructure/ops team, that's your product teams. If you're a product team, that's your customers
14. As an engineer, when we think scale, we think use of our product and if our technology will scale. Scaling a startup is non-trivial in ways outside of technology. The most obvious one is *process*. It is very difficult to scale an organisations process. You'll meet chaos on your journey - it will subside but be prepared for it.
15. Learn to set boundaries between work and your life.
16. Coding is more thinking than writing - one great feature of great developers is thoughtfulness
17. Titles matter - often times you'll implicitly act in accordance with your role. For example, there have been times where I'd keep quiet so as to not stand on anyone's toes. Other times, while having a valuable contribution, I'd feel lazy and dip out since "it's not my responsibility". Either way, leveling up your title gives you access to certain rooms and therefore it does matter.
18. I've learned that leadership is top-down and strong leaders matter. They make all the difference in carving the trajectory of the company, ensuring a high quality of work is done, implementing the right frameworks to promote certain values etc. This is not to say it is "forced", rather that that is their job. My job is to play my part and contribute successfully. Speaking to a friend, he mentioned leadership flows top-down while feedback flows bottom-up. This is essential in keeping a space healthy while leaving leaders to do their best work and set the business up for success by creating the best environment.
19. Experience != skill - don't be overwhelmed by how much others know and think you aren't as technically gifted or lack skill. Experience (especially gathered at the same company) can make someone "seem" more skilled because they have intricate knowledge of the systems they are dealing with. This doesn't make someone more technically gifted than you. Things that actually matter - (read that tweet).
20. Play around with technology early stage - ml -> ml systems -> infrastructure.
21. The quality of engineering at a company is largely due to the precedent set by the senior members of the team. If you can, you should find a company that sets a high bar on engineering practice (in the event you wish to be strong technically). It's not that you yourself can't maintain a high bar individually, it's that you won't feel like you need to. And when you don't need to, you most likely won't.
22. Fight hard to find the right trade-off between feature development and other activities such as addressing tech debt, improving CI/CD pipelines, automating tooling, monitoring your applications etc. By default, you will always go for feature development because it feels more important. There's a reason "feature factories" are a thing. The only way to fight this inclination is to have some sort of precedent on when to address other conerns. And imo, they should be addressed because you can easily end up moving slower than faster due to technical debt or just fighting with your tooling.
23. You cannot learn every technology (at a high-level). Focus on core concepts. For example, if you're excited about microservices, it's easy to end up learning k8s. You'll spend the initial phases learning to *operate* k8s - that's not as useful if you don't need it. Learn the fundamentals - what are containers, linux internals, dns, load balancing etc. They're all the fundamentals and power k8s. You should spend time there rather than learning how to *operate* the technology.
