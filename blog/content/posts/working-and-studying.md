In my final year of undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work part-time for [Aerobotics](https://aerobotics.com/), a startup focusing on agritech. With a passion for development, eagerness to learn and a curiosity for machine learning in the wild, I took the opportunity with both hands but I did have my reservations. How can one juggle their final year of undergraduate studies and perform to an acceptable standard at work? As concerned as I was, it turned out to be an extremely positive and rewarding experience. This post aims to highlight some of the lessons I learned while doing this. It is an extension of a thread of tweets found here (insert link). So, let's get into it!

## Choose the right company

This cannot be understated. If you're going to work and study, the company must be willing to accommodate it. The sole biggest reason for my success at work was that they understood my position and set expectations relative to it. As I was still new to development in industry, my tasks were often scaled so that they were achievable in 2/3 days. This means I played more of a support role for my team, often picking up tasks that did not have large scope and were not mission critical. This gave me plenty of breathing room but still stimulated the right amount of learning. Alongside that, around test/exam time I was allowed to as much time as I needed to ensure I still performed academically.

The right company will also enable the correct environment for you to adjust to your routine. Initially, I did not know how difficult final year would be so I decided to work less days in the week. Often times my working days would change week on week and that was still accommodated for. Overtime, you're able to gauge your capacity better and therefore have a more consistent routine. By the second half of the year, I was working 3 full days a week on a routine schedule. Allowing me the time to figure that out was essential in me having a positive experience.

## Manage your time

This is possibly the most cliche advice anyone could give you but it is vital. Managing your time effectively is key to ensuring you're meeting expectations of both work and university. For me, this looked like planning my upcoming day in the evening. This meant I always knew what I had to achieve on a given day. This compounded into some desirable outcomes such as never needing to worry about missing a deadline or forgetting to complete compulsory work. I found it to be an essential part and really enabled me to achieve the work I needed to on time and to an acceptable quality.

## Start early

This one is relevant in context of university. If procrastination was personified, it would look like your average university student! This crumbles around you when you're juggling work and university. Starting early, and by early I mean 2+ weeks early, gives you more flexibility and control of your assignments and test learning schedule. University work never ends and it is important to give yourself the necessary breathing room. Stress and anxiety are a common part of the university experience, reducing it by active measures is an easy victory. What you don't want is diminished capacity due to poor planning and then having to communicate to your workplace that you cannot meet expectations due to university (in the case it could have been avoided). This is something that will continuously happen if you are not prepared.

I achieved this by starting work roughly 2 weeks early and doing 80-90% of it at that time. I would leave the last 10-20% to a few days before and just close it out at that time. This worked for me as it reduced the amount of stress I had for any given assignment but didn't place a burden on me to finish it immediately. It also gave me enough flexibility to do other work instead of focusing on one thing at a time.

## Be uncomfortable

As is commonly said, you only grow outside of your comfort zone. As a newbie, pretty much everything was outside of my comfort zone! Obviously as time goes on you become more comfortable with the technology and things start becoming comfortable. It is then often easy to keep doing tasks you already have knowledge of, stopping you from growing. To avoid this, I intentionally took on work in which I had minimal to no knowledge on how to complete. This was extremely rewarding and helped me upskill at a more rapid pace. The main advice I have here is be prepared to ask many questions and feel out of your depth. All. The. Time.

## Be humble but not too humble

At the time, I had no industry development experience to my name. I had no experience working with tools like Docker, Spinnaker, AWS, APIs and the list goes on. At this stage in your career and still relevant as you progress, it is extremely important to be humble and listen, learn and absorb all the gems of knowledge the more experienced developers have. There are literally a wealth of knowledge and learning from them is important in making sure you grow as a developer. However, it is equally important to be confident in your abilities and contribute to discussions as anyone else would. You're new, energetic and have a fresh pair of eyes. It is important to voice your opinions and really contribute towards the success of your team.

## Ask questions and engage

By questions, I mean high-level questions such as, "What is the purpose of CI/CD and what problems does it solve?". These are big questions that are important to ask so that you understand the history of development, why these tools are necessary and what their ideal use case is. Again, this helps you grow as a developer and understand the full stack of technology you are using. The part about engaging is important. By engage I mean that before asking such questions, you should read up on them and have some baseline knowledge of what they are. Asking the question then fills in the gaps and helps cement the ideas. I have found this useful as it allows for more critical thinking on your choice of technology and eases any concerns you may have.

## Temperature check with a senior

Make sure you check in with a senior one-on-one regularly. This ensures that someone on the team knows your capacity at all times and your general state of being. This helped me plenty and allowed for expectations to be set correctly. This also is a good chance to communicate how you're feeling about the work you're doing, directions you'd like to go and any general business questions you may have. Additionally, it is a great relationship to form and will undoubtedly benefit you in many other ways over the course of your stay in the company.

## Enjoy the ride

Cliche as you can get but enjoy the journey and have fun! It is a testing time juggling both work and university but it is an incredibly rewarding experience. Development in industry is exciting and the promise of making valuable technology is inspiring. Take the opportunity with both hands and enjoy it!
