# Define a value system

Yes I know, it is obvious. Yet you'd be surprised how many companies have not defined a value system for their company, let alone their technical function. Having a shared value system gives each individual a foundation. It has an impact on the quality of engineering at an organisation. For example, if one of your values is that of early Facebook, "Move fast and break things", you'll undoubtedly promote a culture that is geared towards that end. This will have benefits such as shipping features quickly and regularly, being unafraid of failure and consistently pushing the boundary of innovation. On the flip coin, it could lead to sloppy engineering practice such as lack of testing, no emphasis on writing documentation and not dealing with technical debt. Value systems are important when faced with competing alternatives as they help guide the decision making process.

# Bake great engineering practice into development

This is related to the above point on culture. In order to have a high performance culture, a high standard quality should be expected from every developer. This is not to say that an unduly amount of pressure should be applied on writing the "cleanest code" but that good engineering practice should be the default and expected. A simple example of this is writing tests. Writing tests is often cumbersome and does not give a sense of "progress". Unfortunately, writing tests is best practice ðŸ˜†. If your work is not expected to have a decent set of tests, you'll most likely skip writing them irregardless of your engineering capability and knowledge of best practice. If I don't have to, why would I? Similarly, writing inline documentation for functions is also best practice but is easily avoided if not required.

An emphasis on great engineering practice will bring out the best in your tech team. You can even think of it as a dial. An individual/team's performance sits on a spectrum. For the sake of argument, let's say it ranges from 0 - 5, where 0 is good and 5 is great. If you do not promote good engineering practice, you get the worst performance possible from your team - in this case it's good. If you dial the emphasis right up, you enable your team to work at their best and that is nothing short of great!
