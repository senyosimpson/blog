If there is one sentiment all companies share, it is that they want high performing teams. High performance teams do not just emerge. They are a result of deliberate effort. It takes the right culture and environment, a willingness to experiment with new processes, the humility to accept failure and coffee. Really great coffee â˜•. Oh and definitely **more** meetings because we do not have enough of those! Am I right or am I right?

I've given some thought into what ingredients go into cooking up a high performance team. While there are infinitely many factors that contribute towards this, I'll focusy on aspects that have stood out in my industry journey to date. Some aspects may speak more so to tech teams but I've tried to keep most of it general. This is by no means the gospel on productivity so if your team becomes less productive by taking tips from this, I'm not even a *little* bit sorry ðŸ˜†.

# Define a value system

This is synonymous to defining a culture. Having a shared value system gives each individual a common foundation. It is often underestimated the impact this can have on a team. Value systems, subliminally or otherwise, frame our worldview (in context of the team and work). They promote and reward certain behaviours, therefore strengthening their presence. For example, if one of your values is that of early Facebook, "Move fast and break things", you will promote a culture that is geared toward that end. This will have benefits such as shipping features quickly and regularly, being unafraid of failure and consistently pushing the boundary of innovation. On the flip side, it could lead to sloppy engineering practice. If you are rewarded for moving fast, you will take shortcuts to ensure you do. Over time, this could end up hurting a team's productivity. Nonetheless, the example highlights the framing imposed by value systems. It is important to define one in order to promote desired behaviour. This maps to productivity quite elegantly. Having a well defined value system promotes behaviours that enables teams to operate at peak productivity (give examples).

Another benefit of value systems is their ability to remove ambiguity from the decision making process. When faced with any complex decision, there are several competing alternatives. These can be promoted or excluded depending on how well they align with the team's values. I consider this minor in improving the team's performance, however, it does aid in removing some of the cognitive overhead a team has to deal with.

# Shield your team

In truth, a team's only aim is to deliver on a set of objectives set by the business. The easiest way to do this is for a team to have the space to just do their work without being involved in matters unrelated to them. In practice, this is impossible. Fortunately, it can be combated effectively. Team leads/product managers should shield their team - they're the only entrypoint into engaging a team. To shield means to deal with any requests, complaints, decisions from external parties without involving your team unless necessary. This relies on hierarchy; leaders make choices on behalf of the team. It requires good judgement from the leaders as in some scenarios, going through a more democratic process is the best option. Ultimately, the main aim of shielding is to reduce the burden on the team - they can just focus on delivering on their objectives.

# Wither away process

All companies and teams need processes in place to be efficient. In a startup, the lack of process is often debilitating - it's a growing pain every startup has to go through. Adding processes can quickly become anti-productive if not managed well. Work takes longer to complete due to additional steps, the number of meetings increases and begins eating into your productive hours, the number of decision makers needed increases and consensus becomes more difficult to reach, etc. This is how I see the relationship between productivity and process.

Process should be seen as dynamic and malleable. They are ever-evolving as teams change, priorities change or as we realize they do not cater for our specific set of needs. Every team should strive to have the optimal number of processes and a format that works for them. I would argue that because it is easy to introduce processes, most teams have more of it than they really need. Removing processes is difficult and takes time to get right. To be a high performance team, you want as little overhead as possible. Slimming down processes aids in freeing up time to do what you do best. It is important to continuously evaluate your processes and decide whether they are *truly* serving your team or adding more friction to the process. A simple way to evaluate this is to think about how many "real time hours" are lost/saved from a particular process. I heard about this idea from a colleague of mine, [Andrew](https://andrewvr.dev). Real time hours just denotes the amount of time you actually save or lose due to a process being put in place. Taking a silly example: a team introduces a new process that for any requests dealing with external parties, whoever receives the request is responsible for resolving it. For this team in particular, it ends up being inefficient. Most of the requests require input from the team lead. Due to their policy, even when decisions are made, there is plenty back and forth. Now the team lead and the person who received the request are dealing with the issue and the time taken to resolve it is longer due to the extra communication overhead. Additionally, requests are not well distributed across the team, meaning one person has more of their time taken. In "real time hours", the new process has lost them time. They have introduced a process that cuts into their time to focus on their main work. Evaluating whether a process is eating your "real time hours" is a simple heuristic to determine whether they need to be changed or removed entirely. Slowly withering away or transforming inefficient processes is a step closer to building a high performance team.

# Standardize and evolve

After doing anything for a while, recurring patterns begin to emerge. Teams can take advantage of this by standardizing the response to those patterns. In doing so, there becomes a known way of handling these scenarios. In tech, we can standardize many parts of our work: how we write code, how we deploy applications, how we perform code reviews. Standards are beneficial because they allow for convergence - everything begins to look and feel familiar. For me, this has two benefits. The first is that it reduces the amount of mental effort you have to exert to contextualise and understand something. For example, when writing code, if every developer has a different style, reading and reviewing code becomes more difficult. Your brain has to fight hard to make sense of the world. If the entire team has converged on one style, you immediately can make sense of the world. All that is left is to understand the particular problem the code is addressing and how it was solved. The second is in the face of rudimentary decision making. Standards remove any need to think about how to address a particular situation, you just follow the standard. Both of these aid in, once again, reducing cognitive overhead. There are ways we solve problems as a team, they are well known and actions can be taken without consulting other members.

Standards, like processes, should be dynamic and malleable. Companies and teams are always in flux and our standards (and processes) should evolve as they change. They should be relevant to the team at that point in time. This will allow a team to remain productive even as the environment around them changes. Building flexibility into a team's ethos is essential. A team that can rapidly respond to change is a team set to win.

# Recognize and reward great work

It goes without saying, great work *must* be appreciated, recognized and rewarded. A company and its employees are in a relationship. If individuals feel they are not appreciated and have not been recognized for the hours they've put in, they will find another company that does appreciate and recognize them. Nobody wants to give their maximal effort to a company that does not appreciate all the hard work they've put in.  Recognizing great work goes a long in way in cultivating an amazing culture. From personal experience, it is one facet I've always enjoyed. It's validating to hear that the work you've put in has been noticed and is confirmation that you've *actually* been doing work at a high standard. It's also inspired me to continue giving my best effort. To come full circle, great work should be rewarded. This looks different for everyone - share options, salary increase, promotion. All that matters is that rewards are given when deserved.

# Focus on practical solutions



# Have less meetings

Yes. It is impossible. I know. Still. TRY. HARDER. please ðŸ˜­.
