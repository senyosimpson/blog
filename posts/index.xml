      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading the book Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann. Chapter 5 of the book takes a deep dive into the world of data replication in distributed systems. I have always carried the assumption that data replication is non-trivial but reading the chapter opened my eyes to its true complexity. This post is a summary of the chapter - it can be considered a set of notes. Let&amp;rsquo;s do this ðŸš€</description>

      <description>If you are similar to me, you&amp;rsquo;ve heard about gRPC countless times but have little idea of what it actually is, what its use cases are and why everyone keeps speaking about it. Initially, I thought it must be another buzzword being thrown around. Fortunately, I was wrong ðŸ˜†. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a couple of days reading and learning more about it. This blog post is a summary of all I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.</description>

      <title>Concepts I learned from diving into Clojure</title>

      <description>This year, one of my goals was to learn a functional programming language. I carried this over from last year because who actually achieves their goals, right? To be fair, I did make an attempt - I began learning Haskell. Let&amp;rsquo;s just say, I&amp;rsquo;ll try again one day! Around April this year, on recommendation from one of my mentors, I decided to look into Clojure. It turned out to be a great suggestion and I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying hacking away in Clojure ever since!</description>

      <title>Machine learning in the wild</title>

      <description>Machine learning promises to be transformational, providing much needed innovation across industries ranging from financial services to healthcare to agriculture. The resurgence of machine learning owing to the astonishing performance of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing has prompted industry to jump on the bandwagon and utilise machine learning in their businesses. In fact, entire startups are being built around machine learning alone, promising that their new found algorithms will vastly improve and outperform existing products and services.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned juggling working and studying</title>

      <description>In my final year of undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work part-time for Aerobotics â€• an agritech startup. With a passion for development, an eagerness to learn and a curiosity for machine learning in the wild, I embraced the opportunity fully, despite having some reservations. How would I manage my final year of undergraduate studies and simultaneously deliver at an acceptable standard at work? As concerned as I was, it turned out to be an exceedingly positive and rewarding experience.</description>
