title: "Open Banking"

Recently I have had an increasing fascination with the fintech industry and the innovations software is driving in the field. Companies are able to provide new, innovative financial products and break the barriers that incumbent banks typically face. This has given the consumer better options when it comes to the financial services they utilise. As an engineer, what interests me most is the technology that enables companies to offer such products. The most exciting of these are startups building core banking solutions (Thought Machine, Mambu) and those that are allowing for better connectivity between banks and fintechs - open banking solutions. Some star players in the open banking API world are TrueLayer, Plaid and Tink amongst many others. They build a unified API to access several banks APIs and allow other companies to build financial products or access relevant customer data, allowing for improved financial services, products and personalisation.

## What is open banking?

Investopedia defines open banking as, "a banking practice that provides third-party financial service providers open access to consumer banking, transaction, and other financial data from banks and non-bank financial institutions through the use of application programming interfaces (APIs)." Another way to put it is that open banking is, "a secure way to give providers access to your financial information". This allows all market players to offer improved financial services to the customer base. A good example of this is the [open banking feature in Revolut](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/10/revolut-truelayer/), a challenger bank in the UK. This feature allows customers to connect external bank accounts to the Revolut application. This allows gives them oversight into all their account activity (transactions, balances) all in one application. The value add here is clear and highlights the power of open banking. 

The EU is leading the open banking revolution. They have backed it by introducing regulation to ensure its implementation across the continent (Open Banking and [Payment Services Directive (PSD2)](https://www.openbankproject.com/psd2/)). It's purpose is to encourage competition and innovation in the financial services industry while improving security and fraud prevention. This has allowed for a healthy and growing fintech ecosystem in Europe and is a promising time for banking.

## Case Study - TrueLayer

As stated before, TrueLayer is a company based in London that builds open banking APIs. Under the Open Banking Initiative and PSD2, each bank had to develop APIs that were publically facing. These can all be interfaced with and developers can gain access to the financial data of consumers, with their consent. Naturally, there is an overhead in implementing the 'plumbing' into the APIs of each bank. Each one's interface is slightly different (though they provide the same functionality) and therefore requires a large development effort to integrate. Secondary to this, a company would also require a license to use open banking. TrueLayer, and many others like it, solve these problems for banks and fintechs by creating a unified API that is able to access each banks APIs. Fintech companies can then use this unified API and develop products faster without managing the overhead of each individual integration. Ultimately, this means fintech companies can focus on providing value to their end user through better customer experiences and products, such as the one discussed earlier by Revolut.
