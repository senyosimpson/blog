> Use the right tool for the job

That is a quote I’ve heard all too many times during my career. In fact, I’ve been a strong proponent
of it for a long time and with caveats, I still am. But, as with all things, it ignores the nuance of
the world we find ourselves in.

At some point the term “sociotechnical systems” entered my orbit, I think from [Charity Majors](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy)
of [Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/). If you’re interested on reading more about sociotechnical
systems, [Paul Osman](https://twitter.com/paulosman) wrote a great [piece](https://paulosman.me/2021/10/02/sociotechnical-lenses-into-software-systems/)
on it. The simplest definition of sociotechnical systems I can think of is: people + technology.
*People* build technology, it is an inherently social endeavour.

People are the reason why “use the right tool for the job” is great theoretical advice but poor practical
advice. If using the right tool for the job was simple, we’d all be doing just that. Instead, companies
(made up of people, [for now](https://www.figure.ai/)) have to take into consideration their context.
They have to consider a range of annoying questions like, “do we have the right institutional knowledge
to use this technology”, “do we rewrite legacy systems in OCaml or only use OCaml for new software”,
“can we afford to rearchitect this systems around this new paradigm”. At the individual level, you also
have to ask yourself similar questions, even fun ones like “will this get me a promotion”.

People are hard. We all have different priorities, goals and incentives. Companies are harder. Over
time they have built processes, they have good institutional knowledge of their domain and they have
their [own priorities](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/27/23700629/dropbox-laying-off-500-people-pivoting-ai).
Sometimes, these priorities come with deadlines and deadlines come with their own set of trade-offs.
All of this amounts to a context in which “right tool for the job” is often impractical. If you have
a dev team with strong experience in Python and a 3 month deadline, you can’t just use another language,
especially ones with steep(er) learning curves. You just use Python — it’s the best you can do given
the constraints and environment.

Technology does not exist in a vacuum, we have to keep in mind the people who are building it, the
environments they find themselves in and the constraints placed upon them. "Use the right tool for the
job" dismisses this completely. If we rephrased it, I think we arrive at something practically useful

> Use the right tool for *you* to do the job
