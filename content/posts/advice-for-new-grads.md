## Gather intuition

* ADVICE

I started this year focusing on my execution - the quality of my code and completing it within a reasonable time frame. This, while good in building momentum, had a narrow focus. An important part of growing as a developer is gathering intuition. Intuition enables you to answer more difficult questions: do I need 100% code coverage on this change, what design pattern would work here, is this implementation a bottleneck in the near future, does it make sense to trade-off quality for speed in this instance, etc. This intuition is what differentiates seniors from juniors. It is largely a product of experience. Nonetheless, I found it beneficial to have a more macro view of the problems I was solving and how it fit into our systems. This affords you the opportunity to really think about what it is you're doing and ask (and potentially answer) some more difficult, expansive questions. Additionally, I've found that doing my own retrospectives on mistakes I've made has been extremely valuable. In a few instances, it has prompted me to take action on my own accord. For example, I've redesigned and refactored codebases where the abstractions were poor. The cool part, I'll see if the newer abstractions are any better! Regardless, gathering intuition is necessary as a developer. Take the time to be thoughtful about your work and take a macro view to your work and that of your team.

## Look up from your monitors

* ADVICE

In tech-first companies, it's easy to feel like you (the tech team) are the most important function in the business. We've continously been put on a pedestal as tech companies have become some of the largest companies in the world. Software developrs *make the magic happen*. The idea that any one team is more important than the other, is *utter nonsense*. With that being said, spend time learning more about the business. How do we make revenue, what are our biggest costs, what is our go to market strategy, how does the marketing team come up with campaigns, what our biggest challenges in sales, etc. While I haven't been overly invested in other parts of our business, I do love business development and strategy. I've made a point to understand our business strategy where possible and soak in the details. Being a good developer (or any other role in a company) does not end at doing your job well. You have skills and insights other teams could benefit from - figure out a way to engage with them. It will not only help them but you as well.

## Punch above your weight

* ADVICE

I will sing this song till the day I die. If you're in the right environment, you will have the opportunity to contribute meaningfully above your current level. **Take it with both hands**. Contributing above your level pushes you way outside of your comfort zone. This is the fastest way to grow, albeit the scariest. As a junior, it is easy to feel overwhelmed by how much you do not know
