2021 has simultaneously been the longest and shortest year ever. For the most part it has felt
lacklustre but looking back there were great wins and lessons learned.

## Wins

* I gave my first ever tech talk! It was at the [Rust London meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/)
  on [error handling in Rust](https://senyosimpson.com/posts/rust-error-handling/)
* It gave me the confidence to do more [talks](https://senyosimpson.com/talks/). I ended up doing 6
  this year ðŸš€
* As a result of giving talks, I've met a bunch of people in the Rust community. It's the first professional
  community I've felt a part of and it has been wonderful
* Learning Rust continues to be one of the best economic decisions I've made. It has brought a number
  of amazing career opportunities my way
* I transitioned into a software engineering role focusing on plaform engineering

## Lessons

### Situational context

-- It is how you reason about decisions in your context (especially best practices)
-- Example is testing our prod services at Aero

### Psychological safety

-- You ned safety rails for production systems
-- If not, people won't be fearless working on their systems
-- People *will* make mistakes. Making it difficult to do so is the best way to avoid mistakes

### Developer productivty

-- The way to increase developer productivity is to build in leverage into your development process

### Developer tooling UX

-- We're used to developers being "power users"
-- However, this is a mistake (especially easy with internal platform teams)
-- Make your tools as easy to use as possible

### Best practices

-- It is often aspirational
-- Best practice for you does not mean best practice for everyone (code freezing is very valid given
   the state of your prod systems (this discussion was around during thanksgiving))

### Sharing work publicly

The tweet says it all

### Web3

I still do not understand it.

## 2022

Upwards and onwards  
To infinity and beyond  
Aluta continua  
To an unforgettable year
