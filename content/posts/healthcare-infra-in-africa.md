Being the son of two healthcare professionals, I've always had an interest in healthcare. In fact, I
almost went on to study medicine and was only fully convinced on studying engineering after hearing
about biomedical engineering. Regardless of my clear inclination to healthcare, I've left it unattended
due to the difficulty of building software solutions in the healthcare industry. Add to that the
responsibility of people's lives and it's easy to see why myself or anyone else would be inclined to
spend their time building Snapchat over healthcare infrastructure. So by now you may be thinking, has
my mind changed? Honestly, I'd love to say yes but I still have plenty of apprehension. Nonetheless,
what spurred this change in thinking was this bunch of tweets I posted.

I wrote it with the utmost conviction and I truly do believe it. Introspecting, I thought to myself,
"How can I tweet such a take with so much conviction but do nothing about it? If you really think those
are the most important and impactful companies for Africa's future, why not build one yourself?". To
this I have no excuse. I even have healthcare professionals as parents! Talk about leverage. With all
that being said, I've been thinking and reading about healthcare infrastructure. This post details some
of my thoughts, completely unrefined. I haven't even taken the time to speak to anyone in the field,
barring my father. However, I love to write and felt this is a good way to consolidate my thinking.
On top of that, I feel there is value in sharing it, as rudimentary as the thinking may be.

## The challenge

> Infrastructure is both the backbone for the economy but also the motherboard for technological innovation.

Africa is a continent burdened with poor infrastructure. The grand challenge for the continent for the
foreseeable future is building high quality physical and digital infrastructure. There is a common
rhetoric pushed by the West (and often adopted by us) that Africa will "leapfrog" into the digital era.
This is evidenced by mobile technology. [Fact check]: The majority of Africa skipped building comprehensive
landline networks. Instead, we've "leapfrogged" straight to mobile networks. Mobile phone penetration
has been increasing across the continent, giving many Africans access to digital services for the first
time. M-Pesa, a mobile money solution that offers a suite of financial services, is an example of how
leapfrogging can be utilised effectivley. M-Pesa was particularly successful in providing the unbanked,
the majority of Africans, access to financial services. Despite a lack of comprehensive banking infrastructure,
many Africans were brought into a financial system that worked for them. The hope of the continent is
that we can continue to leapfrog, catch-up technologically and usher in the digital era.

Many have argued that there is a limit to the power of leapfrogging. I agree. The thesis against the
power of leapfrogging is straightforward: without core infrastructure, there is no foundation to build
a strong and healthy economy. Let's take the agriculture industry as an example. Across Africa, inadequate
roads makes it extremely difficult to have high agricultural output. Being able to transport produce
around your country easily is necessary for trade. Without this, farmers are left confined to servicing
the region around them and no further.

## The layers of healthcare infrastructure

Healthcare infrastructure can be split into two layers. These infrastructural layers are realisable
through the topmost layer which is the product layer. The combination of the infrastructural and product
layers power digital-first healthcare systems. These three layers are:

1. Product: Electronic medical record (EMR) and electronic health record (EHR) software - this is the
   software used by medical practitioners to capture health information digitally. Without this layer,
   there is no digital information and therefore no promise of a digital healthcare system.
2. Infrastructure: Health information exchange - this allows for medical and health records to be shared
   securely between healthcare providers. A simplified way to think about this is: email for medical
   data.
3. Infrastructure: Interoperability layer - this comprises of the standards and software that facilitate
   interoperability between different EHR/EMR and HIE systems. Without this, data cannot be exchanged
   between different systems or it can be exchanged but not integrated into the receiving system.
