At a certain level (depending on your field), coding ability stops becoming a massive differentiator between developers.

Software is a team effort - Interpersonal skills matter
Caring about design - from my exp, more advanced developers have a better 'feel' for good design & care about it. They're able to come to logical choices that suit the current needs (with foresight).
Product focus - software is created for the world. Good developers actually care about the outcome of their software, meeting needs of the customer (this can be other developers for internal teams or clients for application developers).
Understand tradeoffs - This exists on two planes in my mind - one is for the product and the other is for tech. On product, it is understanding what building this feature now means in context of the other features that are important. On tech, its having an understanding of what tradeoffs are made by choosing certain technologies and/or design decisions.
Can say no - While this definitely depends on company culture, the ability to say no, with sound reason, to ideas/features that are not reasonable or would sink a team/product.
Fountains of knowledge - able to teach others about their work

# START

As software development professionals, the most straightforward measure of our ability is our technical ability. Ample time is spent learning new languages, tools, design patterns and everything else that comes with the territory. It is necessary and invaluable to spend time honing our craft. I consider development a creative practice. In the same way we imagine musicians, actors, artists and other creatives to put in hours to master their craft, the same should be applied to the art of development. However, like any other discipline, being great at your craft is not the be all and end all. Many junior developers, myself included, aspire to become lead/staff/principal engineers. While it is given that your technical ability should be up to par, there are other aspects that are equally if not more important when transitioning to technical leadership roles. The premise is that once you reach a certain technical level, it stops becoming a *noticeable* distinguishing/differentiating factor between developers. As we aspire towards technical leadership, gradually improving on these other skills is important.

##  Trade-offs are the game of life

If there is one aspect of development that's impossible to escape, it is making trade-offs. In our world, we can simplify trade-offs to existing on two planes. The most obvious is technical trade-offs. Any choice of technology (language, tooling, cloud provider) comes with a one or more, whether you are aware of it or not. In many cases, these choices only begin to rear their head when some level of scale is reached - making it difficult to reverse. The other trade-off is related to the product. We all have finite capacity as individuals and teams. Naturally, a team has to prioritise certain features over others introducing trade-offs. Not all trade-offs are equal - some are fairly benign while others are malignant and can cause a product to fail and/or slow down its development considerably.

Senior and above developers often have a knack for understanding what trade-offs are being made. As they've spent years building and failing, they'd have been burned enough times. 

## Building great software is a team effort

Great software is not built in isolation. Similar to all other aspects of life, teamwork is essential to creating great software that is utilised by millions of people. Given that teams are necessary to software, creating environments for teams to flourish is important. From a manager level this often looks like ... . As individuals in a team that means we have to be transparent, honest, communicate and be considerate to our teammates. As much as promotions are an individual effort, you do not get there by 'outshining' your counterparts. You are all there to reach an objective and empowering, encouraging and supporting everyone in your team is the true essence. When I was applying for a scholarship for university, the last round was a bootcamp. It served as a test of aptitude and was the final round for us to prove to the scholarship that we deserved it. Ultimately this meant that we were all competing against each other for a limited number of positions. Even so, most of our activities were actually group activities and we had to work together as a team to accomplish the tasks. I fondly remember them saying, "Even though you are all competing against each other, you won't get far if you don't work with your team. Trying too hard, taking over the team, not allowing anyone else to speak will act against you".

## Great teams communicate

## Great leaders inspire

## You're in bed with the business

The best engineers are fully invested in the business. Fully investing in the business means you're passionate about the product and the customers. Direction is more important than speed - it is more beneficial to build the *right* thing slowly than the wrong thing quickly. Understanding customer desires and pain points is a byproduct of investment in what you are building. 

## A company is its customers
