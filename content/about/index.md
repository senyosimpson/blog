[Wagwan] 👋🏾, I'm Senyo. I reside in the beautiful city of [Cape Town], South Africa. I work as
a software engineer with a focus on networking and cloud infrastructure. My place of employment is
[fly.io]. My interests are a beautiful confusion between software engineering and operations. I find
joy in both building software and operating it at large scale. I am a fan of the Rust programming
language.
